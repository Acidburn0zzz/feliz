The Achoo! scripts work with you to produce a fast installation of Arch Linux
with a desktop environment and optional extras. These scripts are shared in the
spirit of the community, subject to the terms set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

Burn the iso to a CD or USB stick, or run it directly in Virtualbox. It starts
a live session of Arch Linux, and runs the script. All you have to do is follow
the prompts. Installation follows closely the Arch Wiki beginners' guide, and
hopefully you will understand something of the process by the time it has
finished; you may even like to try a manual installation with the help of the
Wiki.
