Achoo! is a one-woman project. It started as a way for me to automate my own Arch installations, but when I started to share it I found myself adding features, until it has now become quite versatile.

Achoo!'s objective is to always be light and fast - in Virtuablox, with a good internet connection, it can complete a basic installation in 5 minutes, or about 8 minutes for LXDE and the other light desktop environments, to about 11 minutes for Gnome or Cinnamon.

Now featuring an option to add luxuries such as web browser and office suite

The design concept of Achoo! is to accept all the data entry at the start, through a series of simple screens and menus, then it runs automatically on the fast track to the end.
