Please also read the README file.

The Achoo! script was originally written for my own use, but it is shared
in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the
LICENSE file shipped with it, and with no warranty whatsoever. It is
intended to speed up a basic Arch installation plus desktop, with no
user intervention after the drive has been partitioned.

Instead of an interactive menu as provided with other installation
systems, you will make changes to the Variables List at the start of the
script before running it.

The default settings, as written, are for a UK English setup with Xfce
as the desktop environment and LightDM GTK as the greeter, and with
partitioning variables for a Virtualbox installation of 12GiB using
GRUB2 on a MSDOS partition table.

NOTE:
The drive must be partitioned, either prior to running the script, or
using the cfdisk option that is offered at the start of the script.
Either way, you must set the partition variables in the Variables List
near the top of the script, for the partitions you have set up. Failure
to do so will result in the installation of the system to the default
settings in the Variables List (/dev/sda1 & /dev/sda2) and may cause
a loss of data on your system.

# Please note that no provision is included yet for Wifi devices, or

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1)	Read all notes and instructions before starting
2)	Partition the drive to be used (may be done when script is running)
3)	Open the script with Nano or your prefered editor
4)	Scroll down to the Variables List and change as required
5)	Save and exit the script, then run it using: ./Achoo
6)	See how quickly it does the job
