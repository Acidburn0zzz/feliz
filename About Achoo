Achoo! is a one-woman project. It started as a way for me to learn shell scripting by writing a script to automate my own Arch installations, but when I started to share it, I found myself adding features, until it has now become quite versatile.

Achoo!'s objective is to always be light and fast - typically installing in about 8 minutes for LXDE and the other light desktop environments, to about 11 minutes for Gnome or Cinnamon (less than 6 minutes for a basic installation). The design concept is to accept all the data entry at the start, through a series of simple screens and menus, then it runs automatically on the fast track to the end.
