# AchooVariables - Variables for Achoo! Arch Linux Installation Script v0.1

# -------------------------------------
# Achoo! Development version 2015/06/16
# -------------------------------------
# Developed by Elizabeth Mills, incorporating some code adapted from
# the lution-ais script by Carl Duff for Evo/Lution Linux

# --------------------------------------------------
# Please read the following notes before proceeding!
# --------------------------------------------------

# The Achoo! script is in its early stages of development. As such,
# it may be unstable and will contain bugs. It was originally written
# for my own use, but it is shared in the spirit of of the community,
# subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE file
# shipped with it.

# Its purpose is to speed up installation of Arch Linux, plus a desktop
# environment and a greeter, with minimum user intervention. An initiating
# "wizard" is being added that asks for the user's country, username,
# user password and root password, and works with the user to set up 
# their partitioning requirements.

# Initial variables here are for a default UK English setup with Xfce as
# the desktop environment and LXDM display manager, and with partitioning
# variables for a Virtualbox installation of 12GiB. You may changed these
# in this file, or through interaction as the Achoo! script runs. If the
# script fails, check that all your variables are correct and in the
# correct format. You must plan your partition scheme and take care when
# entering your details, or loss of data could occur.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Please note that no provision is included at this stage for Wifi
# devices, or for UEFI, syslinux, GPT or other partitioning schemes
