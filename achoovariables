# achoovariables - Variables for Achoo! Arch Linux Installation Script
# -------------------------------------
# This script and the achoofuncs script must be present when
# running the main Achoo! script

# Developed by Elizabeth Mills, incorporating some code adapted from
# the Evo/Lution script by Carl Duff

# --------------------------------------------------
# Please read the following notes before proceeding!
# --------------------------------------------------

# The Achoo! script is still in development. As such, it may contain bugs.
# It was originally written for my own use, but it is shared in the spirit of
# the community, subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

# Its purpose is to speed up installation of Arch Linux, plus a desktop
# environment and a greeter, with minimum user intervention. An initiating
# "wizard" only essential data of location, username, and passwords, and works
# with the user to set up their partitioning requirements.

# Initial variables here are for a default UK English setup with Xfce as
# the desktop environment and LXDM display manager, and with partitioning
# variables for a Virtualbox installation of 12GiB. You may change these
# in this file, or through interaction as the Achoo! script runs. If the
# script fails, check that all your variables are correct and in the
# correct format. You must plan your partition scheme and take care when
# entering your details, or loss of data could occur.
