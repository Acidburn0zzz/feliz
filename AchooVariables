Achoo! Arch Installation Script version 0.1

Please also read the README file.

The Achoo! script was originally written for my own use, but it is shared
in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the
LICENSE file shipped with it, and with no warranty whatsoever. It is
intended to speed up a basic Arch installation plus desktop, with minimum
user intervention during installation.

You may choose to make changes to the Variables List in the AchooVariables
script before running the main Achoo! script, or elect to change them
interactively when the Achoo! script is running.

The default settings, as written, are for a UK English setup with Xfce
as the desktop environment and LightDM GTK as the greeter, and with
partitioning variables for a Virtualbox installation of 12GiB using
GRUB2 on a MSDOS partition table. You may change them (with discretion).

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Please note that no provision is included yet for Wifi devices, or
# for UEFI, syslinux, GPT or other partitioning schemes
